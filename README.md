The training dataset consist of 10,000 unlabelled images of clothing and other garments. These are sized 28x28px in black and white. Feature extraction is done using t-SNE to reduce from 784 original features to 2. The intialisation method of the k-means algorithm was chosen to be k-means+ and K value of 8 was chosen using silhouette analysis. Model was built done without true labels while true labels were used as part of final evalaution.
